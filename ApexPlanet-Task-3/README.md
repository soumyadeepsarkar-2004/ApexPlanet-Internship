# Task 3 – Quote Generator

Interactive quote generator crafted for the ApexPlanet internship. Fetches inspirational quotes from a public API, pairs them with dynamic backgrounds, and lets users copy or tweet favourites.

## Features
- Async quote fetching with loading states and graceful error handling.
- Theme customiser that changes color palettes and typography on the fly.
- Responsive layout with keyboard-accessible controls.
- Share shortcuts (copy to clipboard, tweet) for quick distribution.

## Usage
Open `index.html` in any modern browser. For reliable API requests during development, serve the project through a local static server to avoid CORS caching issues.
