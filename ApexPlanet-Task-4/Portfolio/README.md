# Task 4 – Portfolio Site

A component-driven portfolio assembled during the ApexPlanet internship. Built with Vite to stitch modular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a polished one-page experience tied to the Soumyadeep Sarkar brand.

## Features
- Component partials combined at build time for consistent layout sections.
- Motion-enhanced hero, skills, projects, and experience panels.
- Mobile friendly navigation with animated menu toggles and scroll-based cues.
- Live clock widget and detail page scaffolding to expand project highlights.

## Usage
```cmd
cd ApexPlanet-Task-4\Portfolio
npm install
npm run dev
```
Visit the dev server URL shown in the terminal (default `http://localhost:5173`). Use `npm run build` followed by `npm run preview` to inspect the production bundle.
