# Task 5 – Shopify

Offline-ready storefront delivered for the ApexPlanet internship. Combines responsive merchandising, persistent cart state, and a light service worker to showcase progressive web app fundamentals.

## Features
- Animated product cards populated from a central JavaScript catalogue.
- LocalStorage-backed cart with quantity tracking and clear-all control.
- Service worker (`sw.js`) caching core assets for offline resilience.
- Sticky glassmorphic header and gradient hero for polished presentation.

## Usage
Open `index.html` in a modern browser to explore the product grid. For accurate service worker testing, serve the folder via a local static server (e.g., `npx serve .`). Use `cart.html` to review and manage basket contents.
